PING-PONG / STACKED FEATURE BRANCH WORKFLOW
==========================================

Goal:
-----
- Use another person’s branch as a base
- Add functionality
- Push ONLY to your own branch
- Repeat this back and forth safely


EXAMPLE BRANCHES
----------------
k = your branch
t = teammate’s branch


PHASE 1: You create the base branch (k)
---------------------------------------
git checkout -b k
# work on functionality A
git add .
git commit -m "Add base functionality"
git push -u origin k


PHASE 2: Teammate builds on your branch but pushes to their own branch (t)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Fetch latest branches
git fetch origin

2. Create their branch from your branch
git checkout -b t origin/k

3. Add functionality
git add .
git commit -m "Add functionality B"

4. Push to their own branch
git push -u origin t


PHASE 3: You build on teammate’s work but push back to your branch (k)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT:
You must be on YOUR branch before pulling their work.

1. Fetch latest remote changes
git fetch origin

2. Switch to your branch
git checkout k

3. Pull teammate’s branch INTO your branch
(Option A: Merge – safest for shared branches)
git merge origin/t

(Option B: Rebase – cleaner history, use carefully)
git rebase origin/t

4. Add more functionality
git add .
git commit -m "Add functionality C"

5. Push ONLY to your branch
git push origin k


MENTAL MODEL (VERY IMPORTANT)
-----------------------------
- You PULL from other branches
- You PUSH from the branch you are currently on

Git does NOT care where code came from,
only where it is being pushed.


VISUAL HISTORY
--------------
k:  A ---------\
                \__ merge -> C
t:      B -----/


BEST PRACTICES
--------------
- Communicate before rebasing shared branches
- Prefer merge for team collaboration
- Rebase only your own unpublished commits
- Keep PRs stacked if needed:
  t -> k
  k -> main


TL;DR COMMAND FLOW
------------------
git fetch origin
git checkout k
git merge origin/t   # or rebase
# work
git commit
git push origin k
